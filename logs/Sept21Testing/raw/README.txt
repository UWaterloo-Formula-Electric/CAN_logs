The car faulted frequently and the lack of electrical/firmware people made it difficult to keep track of the logs.
- Rohan drove the entire day
- I recommend looking through the logs that are large in size
- I uploaded both left and right WSBs but on a quick glance, i believe they are identical which is good.
- The most common fault was hardware overcurrent from the inverter. We also saw apps plausibility triggering a lot due to the brake sticking (also driver's fault).
